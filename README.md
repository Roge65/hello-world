# hello-world
just another repository
Hi my name is Roger, i´m 52 years. i just bought an anrduino and is trying to learn how to program it.
i have two projets i will try.
Firs project mace a random pipe dropper game. I will use 6 servos, each servo wil randomly drop a plastic pipe.
Second project i wnt to use RFID´s to set alarm on and off, and PIR sensors to set the alarm off. The alarm will send a text to my phone, and a sound alarm go off indoors and outdoors.
i fell i have a long way to go to learn enough to do it myselves, as i just started to learn.
